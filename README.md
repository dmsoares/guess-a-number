# Guess a Number!

## Description

This is a simple, quick take at creating a noninteractive _Guess a Number_ clone in Haskell.
It will also probably be a sort of playground for experimenting as I continue to learn more about Haskell and functional programming.

## Installation

Have GHC and Stack (or maybe Cabal?) installed in your system. [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) is a simple, straightforward way of doing it.

### Building the project

Just clone this repo and run `stack build` in its root directory.

### Running

To see the magic happen, you can use Stack as well and do `stack exec guess-a-number` or run the executable directly.

## What if it doesn't work?

Just let me know by opening an issue!
